hello!

# This repository contains outputs for my Applied Physics 157 (Computational Analysis and Modeling in Physics) class. The projects are organized as follows:

## Module A: Machine Learning

### A1 Regression and cross-validation
Curve fitting and validation for synthetically generated data

### A2 Classification, decision trees, and confusion matrices
Morpholigical classification of galaxies using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).

### A3 Principal component analysis (PCA)
PCA applied to the galaxy spectra data from SDSS

## Module B: Image Processing

### B1 Image formation and enhancement
Generation of synthetic color images and manual image enhancements using skimage and pixel value histograms.

### B2 Fourier transform (FFT) in image processing
Generation of synthetic apertures for FFT applications, image convolution to apertures and correlation for image similarity comparisions, texture removal and cleaning using FFT

## Module C: Networks

### Network generation
Calculation of network characteristics, centrality measures, and identification of communities

### Monte Carlo methods
Generation of cosmological constraints using synthetic Hubble diagram data from gravitational-wave (GW) sirens
